# Important editor notes
# - Here [mappings](https://linkml.io/linkml/schemas/uris-and-mappings.html#mappings) indicate closely related templates in other data models
# - Here `extensions.suggests` are used to track the relationship between templates and their intended application to assay data types
# - `abstract` means the template is not meant to be used for annotation, it's just there for others to inherit props from

classes:

  Template:
    abstract: true
    description: A collection of fields representing some entity.
    comments: 
    - Also called a manifest depending on context.


  PartialTemplate:
    abstract: true
    description: A template for collecting a subset of contextual data; not intended to be a standalone template but rather a subdocument.
